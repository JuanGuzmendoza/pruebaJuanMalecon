## üñ•Ô∏è Frontend

The system has a web interface where each entity (crops, farms, technicians, sensors) has its own view and complete CRUD.
Each view communicates with the API via HTTP requests (fetch), allowing visual and real-time data management.

- `/src/Pages` folder: Contains the HTML views for each entity.
- `/src/Js` folder: Contains the JS scripts for each CRUD and the integration with the API.

## üì• Bulk Upload from CSV/Excel

- **Endpoint:** `/api/csv/uploadExcel`
- **Method:** POST
- **Format:** CSV/Excel with columns:
- ID Number
- Customer Name
- Address
- Phone Number
- Email Address
- Platform Used
- Transaction Type
- Transaction Status

The system automatically creates records in the corresponding tables.
The operation is performed in a Sequelize transaction to ensure consistency.
